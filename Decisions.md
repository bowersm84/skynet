## Authentication & User Provisioning (Sprint 4 Final — April 28, 2026)

### Login UX: username, not email
- **Decision:** Login screen shows a "Username" field; the `@skybolt.com` domain is auto-appended client-side before `signInWithPassword`.
- **Why:** Operators don't think of themselves by email address. "mbowers" matches what they'd type into anything else. The full email format is still accepted (a user can paste `mbowers@skybolt.com` and it works) — the convenience is for the typical case.
- **Implementation:** `Login.jsx` has a small static `@skybolt.com` suffix label; submit handler appends if not already present.

### Auth flow type: implicit, not PKCE
- **Decision:** `flowType: 'implicit'` in `supabase.js`.
- **Why:** Supabase's admin invite API (`auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail`) does not honor PKCE regardless of the client's flow type setting. PKCE was attempted; it fails because the admin-issued magic link uses a non-PKCE format. Forcing PKCE on the client just produces unusable links from invite emails. Implicit + the `/confirm-invite` mitigation (below) is what works.

### Email link scanner mitigation
- **Decision:** All Supabase magic links route through SkyNet's own `/confirm-invite` intermediate page. The page calls `supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type })` via POST on a button click — never via a GET URL.
- **Why:** Gmail's link scanner pre-fetches GET URLs in incoming emails. Direct Supabase verify URLs are single-use OTPs — Gmail consumes them before the user can click. The intermediate page absorbs the scanner pre-fetch (static HTML, no harm). Scanners do not execute speculative POSTs, so the actual token verification only fires when the user clicks Continue.
- **Email template requirement:** Use `{{ .TokenHash }}` (the long SHA-256 hex hash, ~64 chars), NOT `{{ .Token }}` (a short numeric OTP code). The `verifyOtp` SDK call expects the hash format under the `token_hash` parameter.
- **Five attempts before this worked.** See "Gmail scanner saga" notes below for the full debugging history.

### Email infrastructure
- **Decision:** AWS SES (us-east-1) via SMTP. Custom MAIL FROM = `bounce.skybolt.com`. DKIM 2048-bit (RSA). DNS via SolidCP.
- **Why:** Supabase's default email sender lands in spam. SES with proper domain verification + custom MAIL FROM provides DMARC alignment via DKIM-strict, which is what Skybolt's existing apex DMARC policy (`p=reject; adkim=s; aspf=s`) demands. The bounce subdomain isolates SES's SPF requirement from the Google Workspace SPF on the apex.
- **Apex SPF/DMARC unchanged.** Touching either could break Google Workspace mail flow. The bounce subdomain has its own SPF (`v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`); the apex DMARC catches alignment failures via DKIM only.
- **Production access granted instantly.** Quota 50K/24h, 14/sec — vastly more than needed (<50 emails/month actual usage).

### Email asset hosting
- **Decision:** Public S3 bucket `skynet-email-assets-skybolt` (us-east-1, public-read) for email images/GIFs. Separate from the private `skynet-files-skybolt` bucket.
- **Why:** Email clients aggressively strip inline SVG (Gmail), block CID-attached images by default, and rate-limit external image fetches. Hosting on a public S3 bucket with stable URLs is the standard solution. The branded GIFs and PNGs render reliably across Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail.
- **Lock icon:** rendered from inline SVG to PNG via `cairosvg` (Python library, much cleaner than hand-drawing). 4.7 KB transparent PNG.

### Self-service password reset
- **Decision:** "Forgot password?" link on the Login screen routes to `/forgot-password`. User enters their username; system calls `resetPasswordForEmail()` with `@skybolt.com` appended. Response is uniform regardless of whether the email exists.
- **Why anti-enumeration:** A different message for "user not found" lets attackers harvest valid usernames. Uniform success message ("If an account exists for X, you'll receive an email") is the standard mitigation. Real success or silent failure both look identical to the user.

### PIN storage: plain text
- **Decision:** `profiles.pin_code` stores 4 digits as plain text. Partial unique index enforces uniqueness (`WHERE pin_code IS NOT NULL`).
- **Why:** Threat model is shoulder-surfing on the shop floor, not remote attack. PINs are 4-digit (10,000 possibilities) — bcrypt would add operational complexity for marginal security gain. Plain text also enables the kiosk's `WHERE pin_code = '1234'` lookup pattern (the PIN both identifies and authenticates the operator).
- **Listed as S5 hardening item.** Hash migration (bcrypt or argon2) is on the post-go-live backlog. Not blocking.

### PIN creation timing
- **Decision:** PIN is captured during `/set-password` (the invite/reset flow), alongside the password. Only for `PIN_REQUIRED_ROLES = ['machinist', 'admin', 'finishing']`.
- **Why:** Setting the PIN at the kiosk before authentication breaks the security model — anyone could claim "I'm Roger and I haven't set a PIN yet." Requiring authentication via the invite token (which is cryptographically bound to a specific user identity) before allowing PIN creation closes the impersonation gap.
- **Other roles (compliance, scheduler, customer_service, assembly) skip the PIN step entirely.** They don't use the kiosks.

### PIN reset behavior
- **Decision:** Admin reset (Armory > Users > Reset PIN) sets `pin_code = NULL`. User sees a soft-prompt modal on next Mainframe load asking them to create a new PIN. Modal is dismissible per session.
- **Why:** Hard requirement (blocking access) is too aggressive for an internal tool. Soft prompt with a "Later" button is courteous but reappears every login until completed. Typically a user will resolve it within one or two sessions.

### Edge Function pattern: `manage-users`
- **Decision:** All admin user CRUD goes through the `manage-users` Supabase Edge Function. Service role key lives only on the server side. Caller is validated as admin via JWT before any action.
- **Why:** The Supabase JS client running in the browser only has the anon key. Admin operations (creating users, resetting passwords) require the service role key, which must never reach the browser. The Edge Function pattern is Supabase's recommended approach for this.
- **Whitelisted update fields:** `role`, `full_name`, `home_location_id`, `can_float`, `can_approve_compliance`, `is_active`. Tampering with `id`, `email`, `created_at` is blocked at the function level (regardless of what the client sends).
- **All actions write to `audit_logs`.**

### Role-based UI gating
- **Decision:** "If you can view a tab, you can edit everything inside it." Single-rule access model. Users tab is the lone exception (admin-only).
- **Implementation:**
  - `TAB_ACCESS_BY_ROLE` map in `Armory.jsx` filters which sub-tabs render
  - `canEditSchedule` / `canCreateWorkOrders` flags in `App.jsx` gate Schedule drag-drop and Mainframe work-order buttons
  - RLS at the database layer mirrors the same constraints (defense in depth)
- **Why:** Multiple permission levels per page (view/edit/admin) creates a combinatorial explosion of states to test. Single rule means QA only verifies "can this role see X?" not "can this role do Y to X?"

## Earlier Decisions (Sprint 1–4 Functional, recap)

### Soft delete throughout
- All deletions use `is_active = false` or `status = 'cancelled'`. Exception: `job_documents` allow hard `DELETE` (RLS policy permits it).
- **Why:** Audit trail. Can recover a "deleted" record by flipping the flag back. Avoids cascade-delete surprises.

### Lot # changes blocked on active jobs
- Once a job is `in_progress`, the material lot # cannot change. Mismatch attempts log to `audit_logs`.
- **Why:** Lot traceability is regulatory. Mid-job changes would fragment the chain of custody.

### PLN trigger at Start Production, not material entry
- Production Lot Number generated at the `in_progress` transition.
- **Why:** Material can be entered, then operator may abandon setup. PLN should only exist for jobs that actually started running.

### Per-batch outsourcing
- Each `finishing_sends` row with a pending external step is independent. Routing step + job status only flip to complete when ALL sends returned AND machining done (`actual_end IS NOT NULL`).
- **Why:** Real-world: Batch A may go to plating before Batch B is even washed. Forcing batch synchronization would block the workflow.

### Effective qty precedence
- Centralized in helpers (`getEffectiveQty`, `getBatchQty`, `lib/traveler.js`). Direct reads of `jobs.quantity` forbidden in qty displays.
- Chain: `qty_override` → `outbound_sends.quantity_returned` (if all returned) → `SUM(finishing_sends.compliance_good_qty)` → `SUM(verified_count − bad_qty)` → `SUM(verified_count)` → `jobs.good_pieces` → `jobs.quantity`.
- **Why:** Six different paths could produce a number; without a canonical chain, different parts of the UI showed different values.

### Forced compliance qty entry
- `Accept` and `Rework` outcomes block submission without `good_qty`. `Reject` does not require qty.
- **Why:** Pre-fix, hundreds of approved batches had `null` good_qty, breaking downstream rollups.

### Job Traveler — live, never stored
- Generated on demand via `lib/traveler.js`. Available from 5 surfaces (Kiosk, Compliance, Finishing, WO Lookup, Print Hub).
- **Why:** Static traveler PDFs went stale instantly. Live HTML always reflects current state.

### Standalone J-FIN jobs
- Auto-numbered `J-FIN-XXXXXX`. `work_order_id` and `assigned_machine_id` nullable.
- **Why:** Purchased springs/clips/cups need finishing without a machining work order. Also covers non-Mazak-5 machines during phased rollout (manual work, no kiosk).

### Date/timezone — local-noon UTC
- User-picked dates (e.g., expected return) stored at local-noon UTC. Display formatted in user's local TZ. Never use `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` directly — that parses at midnight UTC, displaying as previous-day in US Eastern.
- **Why:** Users entered "Jan 15" and saw "Jan 14" — classic timezone bug.

### Document types — nullable
- `document_type_id` can be NULL. Ad-hoc uploads (additional docs, certs not in master list) use null + status=approved.
- **Why:** Forcing every upload into a predefined bucket killed flexibility for compliance review.

### RLS baseline
- Every table needs SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies. Kiosk-read tables also need anon SELECT (kiosks aren't logged in via Supabase Auth).
- **Re-audit before go-live:** `SELECT relname, polcmd, count(*) FROM pg_policies JOIN pg_class ON ...` to find tables missing cmd-specific policies. Sprint 4 patched 14 tables for missing UPDATE and 7 for missing DELETE.

### Supabase query nesting limit
- Never nest more than 2 levels deep in a `.select()`. Fetch separately and merge client-side.
- **Why:** Supabase's PostgREST builder produces increasingly complex SQL with nested joins; deep nesting silently breaks RLS evaluation in some edge cases.

## Operational Notes & Hard-Won Lessons

### The Gmail scanner saga (April 28)
Five distinct auth-flow attempts before settling on the working architecture:
1. **Implicit flow direct.** Email link → Supabase `/verify` → `#access_token=...`. Gmail scanner consumed the verify URL before the user clicked. Result: `otp_expired`.
2. **PKCE flow on client.** `flowType: 'pkce'` in supabase.js. Admin invite API ignored the client config; emails still came as implicit-flow links.
3. **Intermediate page with GET redirect.** `/confirm-invite` redirected to Supabase verify URL on Continue button click. Gmail's scanner followed the redirect chain too.
4. **Intermediate page with POST verifyOtp + `{{ .Token }}`.** Right architecture (POST), wrong token format. Server returned 403 because `{{ .Token }}` is a short OTP, not a hash.
5. **Intermediate page with POST verifyOtp + `{{ .TokenHash }}`.** Working. Long hex hash matches `verifyOtp({ token_hash })` expectation.

**Lesson:** When debugging email-flow issues, always inspect the actual link structure in the email (via Gmail's "View original" or the DevTools Elements panel on the email). Don't assume what the template is producing — read the bytes.

### Phantom git diff state on Google Drive folders
- VS Code git extension showing "modified" files that have no actual content drift is a Google Drive sync race condition. Confirmed by `git diff --stat` returning no output despite 5+ files marked modified.
- **Fix:** Wait for Drive to finish syncing, then refresh VS Code source control panel. State clears on its own.
- **Long-term:** Migrate the working repo off Google Drive to a local SSD path (e.g., `C:\dev\skynet`). Use git itself for cross-machine sync, not Drive.

### Supabase dual-environment migrations
- Test and production are separate Supabase projects. Schema migrations must be run on BOTH or test will lag behind. Discovered when test environment hit `column profiles.username does not exist` after running a migration on production only.
- **Pattern:** SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard, paste migration, run. Repeat on the second project.

### Email template paste regression
- When updating Supabase email templates with new HTML, if you start from an older base template, the link format may revert from `/confirm-invite?token={{ .TokenHash }}` to the default `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`. Always re-verify the link format after pasting.
- **Pattern:** After saving a template, send a test email to yourself, view source, confirm the link is the SkyNet `/confirm-invite` URL — not the raw Supabase verify URL.

### CC prompt format
- Always include "BEFORE STARTING: Read Docs/Decisions.md and Docs/S4_GoLive_Implementation_Plan.md in full" preamble.
- Surgical changes only — exact file, exact lines, exact conditions. Never broad rewrites.
- SQL migrations go in separate code blocks for direct paste into Supabase SQL Editor.
- For new files: deliver as ENTIRE FILES, not Find/Replace blocks. Search/replace patches in CC for full files have failed reliably enough to avoid them.

### Diagnose-before-fix
- Targeted SQL or DOM inspection before any code change. Multiple "React bugs" turned out to be missing RLS policies or wrong email template variables. Two examples this sprint:
  - Rack assignment dropdown not saving → assumed React state bug → was missing RLS UPDATE policy on `material_receiving`
  - Invite link otp_expired → assumed PKCE config issue → was Gmail scanner consuming the GET URL
